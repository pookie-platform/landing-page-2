## Local Build with `pnpm`

First, in order to build the project, you need to use pnpm as it can smartly omit building a Linux dependency `inotify`. First, you can install as the following.

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

Then, download and preview as the following.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

For a more optimised build, run.

```sh
pnpm build && pnpm preview
```

## ~~Local Build with Production Level Optimisations on Docker~~

Note that the current docker image is not working, use the above to run locally.

```sh
docker build -t pookie-career-advisor .
docker run -p 3000:80 pookie-career-advisor
```
