## Local Build with `pnpm`

First, in order to build the project, you need to use pnpm as it can smartly omit building a Linux dependency `inotify`. First, you can install as the following.

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

Then, download and preview as the following.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

## Local Build with Production Level Optimisation

```sh
docker build -t pookie-career-advisor .
docker run -p 3000:80 pookie-career-advisor
```
